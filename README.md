# Tmux from Scratch

This tmux configuration is being build up incrementally from scratch on a video series on my [YouTube channel: MrJakob](https://youtube.com/c/MrJakob).

You may use this configuration as an inspiration to create youre own. Follow the [Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy68GuC77sUQ8mL-alTqsbWO-ghFmw_0L) to get a better understanding of where to start using and configuring Tmux for a more productive terminal environment.

If you are interested my currently used personal configuration and setup, you can always find my complete shell environment in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jakobwesthoff/dotfiles) repository on [github](https://github.com/jakobwesthoff).
